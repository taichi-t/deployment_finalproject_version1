Idaho is a northwestern U.S. state known for mountainous landscapes, and vast swaths of protected wilderness and outdoor recreation areas. The capital, Boise, is set in the Rocky Mountain foothills and is bisected by the Boise River, which is popular for rafting and fishing. The cityâ€™s riverfront Julia Davis Park is a downtown green space containing a rose garden, museums and a zoo. (Source: [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=idaho))
